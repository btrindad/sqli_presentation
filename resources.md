#Resources#

This is a list of resources for anybody interested in learning more about security. There are many more resources than this but my hope is
provide enough to get started. If you are interested, I'd recommend starting with the penetration testing basics. This will give you a good
foundation so that you can focus in the area you are interested in.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or want some advice. My handle on Twitter and IRC is fudog931. You can also send me email

Websites:
* [Null Byte](http://null-byte.wonderhowto.com)
	- This is a fantastic blog with many different subjects that you can dig into. If you already know more or less what you want to
	    explore then this a great resource.
* [CTF Field Guide](https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/)
	- This is a guide for CTF (Capture the Flag) competitions. These are competitions where everyone is given a puzzle (usually in the
	    form of a virtual machine that simulates a security scenario) and teams get points for each piece of information, or flag, they
	    manage to find. These competitions are fun to play with and if you find an old one you can try to solve it. Typically
	    competitors will provide a write-up of how they solved it so you can learn new techniques from them.
	- Recommended CTFs
		+ [CSAW](https://ctf.csaw.io/)
		+ [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/)
		+ [Pentester Lab](https://pentesterlab.com/bootcamp)
* [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page)
	- A community of security professionals. This is a great wiki for learning terminology and getting a better idea of how Cyber
	    Security works from a formal/academic standpoint.
* [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/)
	- This is where the target VM from my presentation came from: [DE-ICE: S1.120](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/de-ice-s1120,10/)
	- There are lots of challenges with different difficulties. If you get stuck most, if not all, VMs have walkthroughs of how other
	    people solved it. I personally enjoyed the [Mr. Robot](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/mr-robot-1,151/) image. Not only because I
	    have fun geeking out over the show, but it also makes you penetrate a Word Press site to solve it. You'll learn some
	    reconassaince, web app attacks, Word Press and PHP vulnerabilities, and how to use Metasploit to make some malware.
* [Cybrary](https://www.cybrary.it/)
	- This is a great resource if you want a more traditional approach. Their classes are excellent and the community is very helpful.
	    This is also a great resource for IT basics and certifications.
* [Software Freedom School](http://www.sofree.us/)
	- Shameless plug! This is run by a mentor and good friend of mine. The classes are all designed to be interactive and to teach open
	    source software to anybody. The classes cover everything from how to build a retro gaming machine from a raspberry pi to open
	    source email clients. There is also a security class that walks you through a VM that comes around about once a year. I highly
	    recommend this if there is a subject you are interested in, or if you just want to meet professionals in the local community.
	- Also every year they hold Linux Camp, where you spend a week in a cabin learning everything you need to pass the Linux
	    Administration Certification test. If you have the opportunity, you should take it. It's a huge bonus to your skills and your
	    resume to be a certified administrator.

Books:
* [The Basics of Hacking and Penetration Testing](https://www.amazon.com/Basics-Hacking-Penetration-Testing-Second/dp/0124116442)
	- This book is available on Amazon, but I also found a copy through the Arthur Lakes website. You should be able to ask the
	    librarians to help you find it, or you can search on their site like I did. It should be available as a PDF so you can keep a
	    copy with you. This is the first book I ever read on penetration testing and it was absolutely fantastic.
	    It should provide a good groundwork to get you started.
* [Blue Team Handbook](http://www.blueteamhandbook.com/)
* [Cyber Kill Chain](http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/deconstructing-the-cyber-kill-chain/a/d-id/1317542)
	- This was originally a concept set up by Lockheed Martin. They have since taken down their site explaining it, and I think this is
	    a great explanation why. This page should give you a good overview of what the Kill Chain was and why it's not being used
	    anymore. But it is a fantastic primer on how to think like a hacker.
* [No Starch Press](https://www.nostarch.com/)
	- This is a publisher that focuses on Technology, Math, and overall Geekiness. They have __THE__ core reading books for cyber
	    security. They also have a bunch of other books about anything else in Computer Science. Look around, ocassionally they'll be a
	    part of a [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com) too and you can save a lot of money.
* [Smart Girl's Guide to Privacy](https://www.nostarch.com/smartgirlsguide)
	- I can't recommend this book enough, no matter your gender. This is simultaneously a book on how to be safe online and an eye
	    opening experience in to how hard it can be for women in technology (at least it was eye opening for me). This is a book meant
	    for everybody, not just for hackers, and if you only purchase one book in this field I'd recommend this one.

As a general note, if you want to work in this kind of field or administration/operation in general I highly recommend you get comfortable
with at least one scripting language. Languages like C++ or Java are very valuable if you're writing a tool, but often times you'll find you
need to automate tasks or parse a log file, etc. For these tasks it is far more convenient to use a script since it is more portable and
easier to edit as time goes on. Python seems to be the most popular nowadays, I personally prefer Ruby (I'm also a fan of Perl). Regardless
of what you choose, make sure you have at least one go to scripting language and are comfortable in a Linux terminal.
